# rofi-password-store

This was a quick project inspired by
[rofi-pass](https://github.com/carnager/rofi-pass). I have been using
rofi-pass for about three years and over time have wanted a few
features. The main features was support for nested yaml and working
around a few bugs in rofi-pass.

 - rofi
 - gnupg
